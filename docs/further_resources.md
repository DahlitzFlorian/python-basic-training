# Further Resources

Here you'll find a list of resources, which I can highly recommend.

**Real Python:** [Real Python](realpython) is an online website, which provides articles and video courses for beginners and intermediate programmers.
They have a bunch of well-known authors and explain even more complex concept for people with little or no programming background.

**Trey Hunner:** Trey Hunner is a popular Python developer, who helps Python developers level-up their skills through a weekly online exercise service and trainings.
Furthermore, he publishes a lot of great and deep dive articles about Python concepts.
You should definitely check out [his blog][treyhunner]!

**Python Documentation:** The official [Python Documentation][pythondocs] is well documented and worth to consider if you come across code and concepts, you don't understand.
Additionally, here's a direct link to the [standard library][standardlib] section of the documentation.

> **Note:** Be sure to read the docs for Python 3! Python 2 won't be maintained after January 1st 2020, but most of the links you find on StackOverflow or Google point to Python 2 resources.
> So be careful.

**HackerRank:** [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is a technology company that focuses on competitive programming challenges for both consumers and businesses, where developers compete by trying to program according to provided specifications.
There are a bunch of challenges, which you can try to solve using Python.
It's definitely worth checking it out.

**PyBites:** [PyBites](https://pybit.es/) is an online platform, providing challenges and How To's around Python.
The initiators (Bob and Julian) started this platform to learn Python on their own.
They created challenges for each other and tried to solve them.
Eventually, the made it public for everyone, so that you can learn together with them!
