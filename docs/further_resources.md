# Further Resources

Here you'll find a list of resources, which I can highly recommend.

**Real Python:** [Real Python](realpython) is an online website, which provides articles and video courses for beginners and intermediate programmers.
They have a bunch of well-known authors and explain even more complex concept for people with little or no programming background.

**Trey Hunner:** Trey Hunner is a popular Python developer, who helps Python developers level-up their skills through a weekly online exercise service and trainings.
Furthermore, he publishes a lot of great and deep dive articles about Python concepts.
You should definitely check out [his blog][treyhunner]!

**Python Documentation:** The official [Python Documentation][pythondocs] is well documented and worth to consider if you come across code and concepts, you don't understand.
Additionally, here's a direct link to the [standard library][standardlib] section of the documentation.

> **Note:** Be sure to read the docs for Python 3! Python 2 won't be maintained after January 1st 2020, but most of the links you find on StackOverflow or Google point to Python 2 resources.
> So be careful.
