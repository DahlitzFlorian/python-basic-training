# Loops

This section covers Python's ability to loop/iterate over iterables.
An iterable can be anything, you can iterate over, e.g. lists, dicts, sets, ranges.


## for-Loop

Python's `for`-loop is used to perform *definite iterations*.
A definite iteration is an iteration, in which the number of repetitions is specified explicitly in advance.
Let's assume we have a list of names and we want to print each name on a different line.
We could do so, by using a `for`-loop.

```python
>>> names = ["Michael", "Florian", "Anna", "Sabrina"]
>>> for name in names:
...     print(name)
...
Michael
Florian
Anna
Sabrina
```

If you want to print all numbers in a certain range, you can make use of the built-in `range` function.

```python
>>> for i in range(3):
...     print(i)
...
0
1
2
```


## while-Loop

Sometimes you need to perform *indefinite iterations*.
In contrast to definite iterations the number of times the loop is executed isnâ€™t specified explicitly in advance.
Rather, the designated block is executed repeatedly as long as some condition is met.

```python
>>> x = 5
>>> while x > 1:
...     print(x)
...     x -= 1
...
5
4
3
2
```

> **Note:** Loops can be nested as well!
> But as with conditional statements, keep in mind that this decreases code readability.
