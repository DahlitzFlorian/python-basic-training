# Python Training: Beginners

## Description

This is part one of (maybe) a three-part series.
The goal of this trainings session is to give programming beginners a sense of what Python is and what it consists of, teach them basic programming concepts as well as providing examples of how to implement discussed concepts in Python.

**Note:** As this is a new trainings course, all examples are in Python 3 only.
There is no intention to port it backwards to legacy Python (Python 2).

## Repository Structure

`code`: Contains exercises and possible solutions related to the trainings session.
You don't need to install any further software or package.
However, make sure to have Python 3.6 or greater installed as the sample solutions use *f-strings* for printing.

`docs`: The docs directory contains the Sphinx documentation, which is hosted [here][OnlineWebsite].
As a participant in the training, this won't be interesting for you.

`presentation`: Contains the slides, which were used during the session.
