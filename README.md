# Python Training: Beginners

## Description

This is part one of (maybe) a three-part series.
The goal of this trainings session is to give programming beginners a sense of what Python is and what it consists of, teach them basic programming concepts as well as providing examples of how to implement discussed concepts in Python.

**Note:** As this is a new trainings course, all examples are in Python 3 only.
There is no intention to port it backwards to legacy Python (Python 2).
